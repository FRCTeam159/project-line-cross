# Project Line Cross

Welcome to Project Line Cross, a public Git repository committed to ensuring that every robot will be able to cross the line in autonomous mode during the 2018 FRC game, FIRST Powerup.

The code committed here will be free as in speech and beer, and anyone is free to submit a PR in any language provided that it follows the following guidelines:

## Each implementation should:
- Be placed in a directory that has the same name as the language that the implementation is written in
- Be as generic as possible so that it can be applied to any robot on the field with minimal setup
- Be as simple as possible so that any team has the capacity to understand it.
- Have as many comments it needs to have in order to be understood by any team.
- Make a robot cross the line in autonomous mode with as little setup as possible.

It is our goal that the community will work together on this and ensure that every robot this year has the ability to cross the line!
